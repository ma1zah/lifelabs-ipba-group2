          <h3>Gender Inequality</h3>
          <p>Welcome. This is a documentary diving into gender inequality's root causes.  Continue reading to see and learn our brainstorming techniques - mind maps, five whys, fishbone diagrams, and starbursting - to generate solutions.</p>
          <p>Gender inequality is when people are treated differently based on their gender, usually favoring one over the other. It’s like saying boys or girls should do certain things just because of their gender, instead of letting 
            everyone choose what they like and are good at. This isn’t fair, and everyone should have equal opportunities, no mater if they’re a boy or a girl. Gender inequality happens in various ways, like unequal pay or thinking 
            that certain jobs are only for one gender. It’s important to treat everyone with respect and give everyone a chance  to shine.

          <p>In our mind map, each subtopic branches out from the main topic, and we can further expand on each subtopic with details or examples. Mind mapping is great for brainstorming because it allows u to see connections between 
            different aspects of a topic and helps generate more ideas. It’s like creating a visual guide that inspire deeper thoughts and discussions on each area of gender inequality.</p>

          <p>The Five Whys is a way to dig into the root causes of a problem. We started with questions and then asked why five times to get the root cause.

          <p>The Fishbone, also known as Ishikawa or Cause-and-Effect diagram, helps explore the causes behind a specific issue. Each spine can be explored further to uncover specific causes within those categories. The Fishbone Diagram 
            helps visualize and understand the connected factors contributing to gender inequality.</p>

          <p>Starbusting is a way thoroughly explore a topic by asking Who, Why, How, and When questions.</p>
          <p>Gender inequality is a issue that is deeply rooted in historical power imbalances, cultural expectation and discriminatory. It affects both men and women but disproportionately impacts women. While no single entity is solely 
            responsible, societal norms and individual actions play crucial roles. The normalization of gender inequality underscores the need for continuous efforts to challenge stereotypes, promote inclusivity, and advocate for policy 
            changes. Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach, including education, open discussions, and active efforts to create equal opportunities. As we strive to eliminate gender inequality, fostering awareness and 
            understanding of its historical context and perpetuating factors is essential for building a more equitable and fair society.</p>

       <h1>Story / History</h1>
          <h2>Start of Shang Dynasty</h2>
          <p>The Shang Dynasty, which began when a tribal chief named Tang defeated the Xia Dynasty in 1600 B.C., has the earliest written records in Chinese history. Jie, a tyrant, ruled over the country. This victory is known as the Battle of Mingtiao, which took place during a thunderstorm. Jie survived the battle but died of an illness later. Tang is known for establishing a low number of drafted soldiers in the army and initiating social programs to assist the poor of the kingdom.<p>
              <h2>Shang Cities</h2>
      <p>There were several large settlements during the Shang Dynasty, including Zhengzhou and Anyang, though these are not thought to have been as densely urban as Mesopotamian settlements at the same time.
      Around 1300 B.C., Anyang became the capital. under King Pan Geng and was known as Yin at the time. Zhengzhou is famous for its four-mile-long walls that are 32 feet high and 65 feet thick.
      Anyang is thought to be the city from which Shang kings ruled for more than two centuries, with altars, temples, and palaces in the center. Surrounding the political center were artisans, including stone carvers, bronze workers, potters, and others, as well as small housing structures and burial sites.</p>
      <h2>Shang Dynasty Religion</h2>
      <p>Much of the Shang Dynasty's history has been deciphered from oracle bones discovered in Anyang, which depict a kingdom at war with shifting alliances with other powers.
      Prisoners of war were either sold as slaves or slaughtered for sacrifice. Sacrifice was practiced within the religion, sometimes in large groups.
      In Shang culture, the king also served as a priest. Ancestors were thought to communicate through the god Di, and the Shang king oversaw the worship of Shangdi, the supreme ancestor, as well as communication with the other ancestors. A group of mystics received the ancestors' wishes, which were then interpreted by the king.</p>
        <h2>Shang Graves</h2>
        <p>Subordinates were buried alongside their ruler in the chambers during the first half of Shang rule. The number of bodies in each burial had increased by the end of the dynasty. Anyang has one grave dating from around 1200 B.C. housed the unnamed ruler's cadaver, as well as 74 human bodies, horses, and dogs.
      Shang rulers would even dispatch hunting parties to the northwest to capture members of primitive tribes for use as sacrificial bodies in royal burial sites.
      Lady Hao's Anyang grave from around 1250 B.C. not only includes 16 human sacrifices, including children, but also a large number of valuable objects such as bronze and jade ornaments and weapons, stone sculptures, bone hairpins, and arrowheads and several ivory carvings. There are also 60 bronze wine vessels with animal images in the grave.<p>
      Lady Hao is thought to be King Wu Ding's wife, who ruled for 59 years. Inscriptions on her bones show that she led several significant military campaigns during her lifetime.
      <h2>Fall of the Shang Dynasty</h2>
      <p>The Shang Dynasty came to an end around 1046 B.C. The final king in the Shang lineage, King Di Xin, was regarded as a cruel leader who enjoyed torturing people, prompting calls for his overthrow.
      The Zhou army, led by King Wu, marched on the capital city, entrusted with protecting the kingdom's western frontier. Di Xin armed nearly 200,000 slaves to supplement the defending army, but they defected to the Zhou forces. During the Battle of Muye, many Shang soldiers refused to fight the Zhou, even joining the opposing side.
      Di Xin committed suicide by setting fire to his palace. The incoming Zhou dynasty would rule for 800 years, though the Shang Dynasty had left an indelible mark on Chinese history.<p>
